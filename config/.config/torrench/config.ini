## KAT Proxy is quite shaky, and might not work at all times
## I have been unable to find any reliable KAT proxy.
## If you know of some working proxy, you can edit KAT_URL with that working proxy
## Simply append the proxy (either in the beginning or at the end)
## Update me if it works?
## Alternatively, use TPB/SkyTorrent. They are pretty reliable and work most of the time.
